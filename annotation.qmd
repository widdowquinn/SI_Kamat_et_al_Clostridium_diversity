## Analysis

To ensure consistency of single-copy orthologue analyses (so that analysis results are not confounded with choice of annotation/gene-calling tool) all genomes in `assets/analysis/2021-06-19_ANIm/bolteae_clostridioforme_symbiosum_genomes` **except for the lower-quality initial assemblies of LM19B, LM19R, LM41A and LM42D** had CDS called by `prodigal` v2.6.3, using the `assets/analysis/01-call_cds.sh` script:

```bash
bash call_cds.sh
```

## Output

Output can be found in the repository subdirectory `assets/analysis/2021-06-22_CDS` under three directories:

- `cds`: the CDS on the genome (FASTA)
- `proteins`: the conceptual translations of those CDS (FASTA)
- `gbk`: annotated genome files (GenBank)
