## Analysis

Orthologue finding was carried out on the protein sequences predicted by `prodigal` in the directory `/assets/analysis/2021-06-22_CDS/proteins` using `orthofinder` v2.5.2. This was run on a CLIMB-MRC server with the command:

```bash
orthofinder -t 8 -a 8 -f 2021-06-22_CDS/proteins/ -o 2021-07-07_orthofinder
```

**NOTE**: this analysis was not conducted on the Nanopore-only assembly annotations, as their CDS were suspected to be of low quality.

## Output

Output is placed in the subdirectory `/assets/analysis/2021-07-07_OrthoFinder` under the following directories:

- `Single_Copy_Orthologue_Sequences`: contains 974 multiple sequence (protein) FASTA files containing predicted single-copy orthologues from the 70-genome set of annotated proteins
- `Species_Tree`: the species tree built by `orthofinder` and used for identification of orthologues.
