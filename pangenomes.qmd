## Analysis

All genomes were reannotated with `prokka` using the script `03-prokka.snakefile`, and subdivided into groups by species, as determined by [ANIm analysis](anim.qmd), in the subdirectory `assets/analysis/2021-08-19_split_genomes`, using the script `split_species.py`.

These genomes were then analysed by `roary` v3.12.0 using the script `04-roary.sh`.

## Output

`roary` output is subdivided by species group in the subdirectory `assets/analysis/2021-08-19_roary`.
